PyQtExamples
============

C++ Examples from Qt documentation translated into Python.

Programming in Python using PyQt requires that you understand Qt C++ API and translate it to Python on the fly. This is not easy if you're not proficient in C++. In order to teach myself to do that, I started rewriting some of Qt examples into Python. This allows me to see the various widgets in action.

These files are provided here in the hope that they may help anyone getting started in PyQt.
